# Whose Paw?
A small project to help lost cats and their humans find each other.\
**Live demo**: https://ekvisa.github.io/WhosePaw/

## About
This project is a tool for sharing information about lost and found cats.\
If you’ve lost a cat, you can add a card with a description and contacts.\
If you’ve seen an unfamiliar cat in your neighborhood, you can search existing posts or add a sighting.\
The idea is to reduce the distance between "I’m looking for my cat" and "I think I’ve seen this one".

## How it works
#### There are two main lists:
  - **Lost cats** — cats that are missing
  - **Found cats** — cats that were seen but not identified
#### Two main actions:
  - **Add a cat** (lost or found)
  - **Search for a cat** using filters and descriptions
#### Typical scenarios:
- You see a new cat outside → search the site → find a matching post → contact the owner
- You lose your cat → add a post → someone who met the cat can find you

## Tech stack

## Note
The project uses Render’s free hosting, so the first request might be slow while the server wakes up.\
The cats are worth waiting 🐾
